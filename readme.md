# Julie's hire shop
This is a small project for ncea l2's as91896 using python to create an interface for a hire shop.

### Libraries
I use **customtkinter** for the gui, and use it over tkinter to have a more modern and sleek look.<br>
For image loading, I use **pillow** to load an image and communicate with customtkinter to display it.

### Buidling
Make sure to have python3 installed on your machine and added to path, then run these commands to run the program.
```bash 
pip install customtkinter pillow
git clone https://github.com/oliwilliams1/Hire-Shop-2
cd Hire-Shop-2/
python main.py
```
